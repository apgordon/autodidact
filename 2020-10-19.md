Today I went through the *Introduction to AWS for Non-Engineers: Cloud Concepts* course on LinkedIn Learning.

I'd heard of SaaS before, but the course mentioned about "IaaS" (Infrastructure as a Service) and "PaaS" (Platform as a Service), which I had to Google about.

I'd also never heard of Route 53, Amazon's domain registrar.

Also, by the end, I think "EC2" just boils down to virtual servers on AWS.

Next up is *Introduction to AWS for Non-Engineers: Security*.
