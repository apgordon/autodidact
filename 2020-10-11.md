Ran `rails t` for the first time. Was pretty fun doing some basic TDD and intentionally getting a fail, then fixing.

Seems like there's a lot to learn re: Rails testing syntax. I followed Hartl's lead with the very basic syntax to test routes.

I think the Hartl video I'm using is from Rails 4. It suggested using `<% provide(:title, "foo") %>`. I had trouble getting that to work so ended up using `<% content_for :title, "Foo" %>` which I found on SO. That worked.

The next part of the Hartl tutorial seems to be about Ruby basics. Might skim through that quickly to get down to Bootstrap and custom CSS...
