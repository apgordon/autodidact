Today I started going through the *Introduction to AWS for Non-Engineers: Security* course on LinkedIn Learning.

Learned about AWS' Shared Responsibility Model. (AWS responsible for *the* cloud, while customer responsible for what's *in* the cloud)

Finally know what IAM means (Identify and Access Management).

Course talked about making sure there's security at different levels of an application, including subnet, load balancer, and OS. Sorta get this, but don't know what a subnet means.

Concept of data being "at rest" vs. "in transit".

Just got through the first couple videos in the intro... more tomorrow.
