## Renaming a Heroku domain

I used the `heroku apps:rename newname --app oldname` command I found from [this Heroku help page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/renaming-apps) to rename the Heroku domain I'm using for my [*Toy app*](https://github.com/apgordon/toy_app) (from Michael Hartl's Rails 6 video series).

Some things I stumbled through:

* I didn't realize I had to be in the local directory where my `toy_app` code was when using the command.
* I didn't realize there was a 30 character limit on the Heroku domain slug.

Eventually got it working though.

## git clone

I still forget that when using `git clone`, the directory gets created as part of the command.

I expect *just the code* to drop in, so I make a directory first.

Buuut, nope.
