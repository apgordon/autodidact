Today at work, I stumbled on something I've been meaning to look up for a while. Some sort of standard around Git commit messages. Found via [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

I also realized that it's possible to add commits that span multiple lines. Apparently if you just hit `Enter` without adding a closing parentheses, you can add additional lines.

A friend who now works at LinkedIn gifted my 6 months free Premium, so lately I've been going through the courses, earmarking ones I'd like to go through. I started with one about how AWS services are billed, which was totally out of order, but *:shrug:*. So far I've learned AWS offers some stuff for free, some stuff for a trial, and lots of stuff on a sliding price scale, from reasonable to a LOT of money. Was cool to see S3, Glacier, and Deep Glacier price points, and finally make sense of something I'd heard about from Videology data guys many years ago.  

Next I want to do more of the AWS stuff, but probably in order, then some UX stuff, maybe a Git course, and then the Rails course after I finish the Hartl course I'm in the middle of.
